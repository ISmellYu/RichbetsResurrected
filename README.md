# RichbetsResurrected
Probably my most complex and fun project ever done together with [Drairan9](https://github.com/Drairan9). The project includes roulette, a custom made unity game called "spacerun", slots and on site nick customization.\
All this combined with a database running on mysql and discord.\
Fell free to learn from it or something else\
**Project done only for learning purposes**

# Technologies
In this project we used `ASP.NET Core` as main backed server, `SignalR` as realtime communication, `Swagger` as documentation for endpoints and plain `css` and `html`
